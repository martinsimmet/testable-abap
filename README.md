## Project Testable Temperature Converter

Create a piece of software (ABAP) that is capable of converting temperature values from one unit to anther. Supported units of temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
The code should be tested using unit tests. These unit tests should get implemented first, then the implementation of the converter follows.  (Test Driven Development)

### Milestones:

-**Step 1:**
Provide the skeleton implementation of the converter API. (Public Methods are defined but not yet implemented.)

-**Step 2:**
Find a meaningful set of test cases and implement them using ABAP Unit.
