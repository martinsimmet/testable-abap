## [Project Testable Temperature Converter](https://github.com/martinsimmet/testable-abap/projects/1)

This project should demontrate one possible way of creating testable ABAP code. There are several milestones that correspond to branches allowing you to follow the steps along.

### [Milestones](https://github.com/martinsimmet/testable-abap/milestones):

-**[Step 1](https://github.com/martinsimmet/testable-abap/milestone/1):**
Provide the skeleton implementation of the converter API. (Public Methods are defined but not yet implemented.)

-**[Step 2](https://github.com/martinsimmet/testable-abap/milestone/2):**
Find a meaningful set of test cases and implement them using ABAP Unit.

-**[Step 3](https://github.com/martinsimmet/testable-abap/milestone/3):**
Implement the logic of the temperature converter until unit tests run successfully.
